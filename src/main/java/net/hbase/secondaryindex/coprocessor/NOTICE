Coprocessor building secondary index

You can add a table coprocessor by setting a table coprocessor attribute:

  hbase> alter 't1', METHOD => 'table_att',
    'coprocessor'=>'hdfs:///foo.jar|com.foo.FooRegionObserver|1001|arg1=1,arg2=2'

Since you can have multiple coprocessors configured for a table, a
sequence number will be automatically appended to the attribute name
to uniquely identify it.

The coprocessor attribute must match the pattern below in order for
the framework to understand how to load the coprocessor classes:

  [coprocessor jar file location] | class name | [priority] | [arguments]
